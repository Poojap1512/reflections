How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

 It helps to compare to files line by line.
 So, helps to find the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Yes having easy access can help finding bugs and spot differences
    in different versions of files.
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   The commit size may not be proper as it depends on the person who hadles it.
   It may be convenient to store a commit at a desired moment like after a logical change
   and may prove useful.s

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Multiple files may be linked. So, it is wise to save all the files at once. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log is used to view different commits  of single or multiple files and the user given description.
    Git diff is used to compare two different files and the changes in those files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    As i can restore to an earlier point when my code was working right.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

   Git can be used for version-control
