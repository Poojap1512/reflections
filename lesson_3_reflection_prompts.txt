When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
In order to collaborate work with other people so that i can keep updating and others can keep adding their code too.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Many people might keep making updates on GitHub. So, manually pulling enables one to pull commits when needed.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are used to copy someones repository on GitHub. Clones are used to copy repository on local machine or from GitHub to local machine.
Branches are used on the same repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The benefit is getting to know the latest modification or bug fixes so that I do not waste time over the same modification or bug.
